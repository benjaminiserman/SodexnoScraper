SodexoScraper is a quick script that scrapes allergen info from Sodexo @ Dakota State University's menus between the dates August 15th 2021 and December 6th 2021.

The release includes the source code, executeable, and scraped data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [You use a machine supported by .NET 6](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/supported-os.md)
- You have .NET 6 installed
- You have downloaded the file "SodexoScraper.zip" from the latest release.

## Usage

To run the provided executeable:
1. Download the "SodexoScraper.zip" file from the latest release.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Run the file "bin/Debug/net6.0" within the unzipped folder and run it.
This will provide the same results already provided within "SodexoScraper.zip"

The start and end dates are fixed right now. If you'd like it changed to take user input, feel free to [contact me](mailto:winggar1228@gmail.com). The reason it doesn't take user input at the moment is because it was just a quick script I needed for something. I have other things to focus on right now, but I'll update if anyone needs it.
